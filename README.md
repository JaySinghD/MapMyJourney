# üó∫Ô∏è MapMyJourney: GIS-Based Trip Planner for Tourists

## Overview
**MapMyJourney** is a high-performance, user-friendly GIS (Geographic Information System) application designed to help tourists plan trips with ease. This project was developed as part of the University of Toronto‚Äôs ECE297 course and integrates advanced algorithms, intuitive UI features, and real-time responsiveness to deliver a tailored travel planning experience.

## Key Features

### Trip Planning Tools
- **Popover Information**: Clickable map elements reveal details like name, address, and hours.
- **Itinerary Builder**: Add destinations with editable visit times and reorder them for efficiency.
- **Subway Visualization**: Toggle subway stations and lines for better transit planning.
  
### Responsiveness
- **Zoom-Level Optimization**: Varying detail levels based on zoom to reduce rendering time.
- **Fast Pathfinding**: Uses A* and Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm for near-instant route calculations.

### Optimization Algorithms
- **Ant Colony Optimization**: Simulates pheromone trails to find efficient travel routes.
- **2-Opt Refinement**: Tweaks existing paths to improve quality-of-results (QoR).
